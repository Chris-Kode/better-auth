description: Admin plugin for Better Auth
---

The Admin plugin provides a set of administrative functions for user management in your application. It allows administrators to perform various operations such as creating users, managing user roles, banning/unbanning users, impersonating users, and more.


## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To use the Admin plugin, add it to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { admin } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            admin() // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Migrate your database

    Run the migration command to create the necessary tables in your database.

    ```bash title="terminal"
    npx better-auth migrate
    ```

    Or, you can generate the required tables with:

    ```bash title="terminal"
    npx better-auth generate
    ```

    Refer to the [Schema section](#schema) to see which fields this plugin requires. You can also manually add these fields to your database.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Next, include the anonymous client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { adminClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    const client = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            adminClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Before performing any admin operations, the user must be authenticated with an admin account. An admin is any user assigned the `admin` role. For the first admin user, you'll need to manually assign the `admin` role to their account in your database.

### Create User

Allows an admin to create a new user.

```ts
const newUser = await client.admin.createUser({
  name: "Test User",
  email: "test@example.com",
  password: "password123",
  role: "user"
});
```

### List Users

Allows an admin to list all users in the database.

```ts
const users = await client.admin.listUsers({
    query: {
        limit: 10,
    }
});
```
By default, 100 users are returned. You can adjust the limit and offset using the following query parameters:

- `limit`: The number of users to return.
- `offset`: The number of users to skip.
- `sortBy`: The field to sort the users by.
- `sortDirection`: The direction to sort the users by. Defaults to `asc`.

```ts
const users = await client.admin.listUsers({
    query: {
        limit: 10,
        offset: 0,
        sortBy: "createdAt",
        sortDirection: "desc"
    }
});
```

### Set User Role

Changes the role of a user.

```ts
const updatedUser = await client.admin.setRole({
  userId: "user_id_here",
  role: "admin"
});
```

### Ban User

Bans a user, preventing them from signing in and revokes all of their existing sessions.

```ts
const bannedUser = await client.admin.banUser({
  userId: "user_id_here"
});
```

### Unban User

Removes the ban from a user, allowing them to sign in again.

```ts
const unbannedUser = await client.admin.unbanUser({
  userId: "user_id_here"
});
```

### List User Sessions

Lists all sessions for a user.

```ts
const sessions = await client.admin.listSessions({
  userId: "user_id_here"
});
```

### Impersonate User

Allows an admin to create a session as if they were the specified user.

```ts
const impersonatedSession = await client.admin.impersonateUser({
  userId: "user_id_here"
});
```

### Remove User

Hard deletes a user from the database.

```ts
const deletedUser = await client.admin.removeUser({
  userId: "user_id_here"
});
```

## Schema

This plugin adds the following fields to the `user` table:

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        {
            name: "role",
            type: "string",
            description: "The user's role. Defaults to `user`. Admins will have the `admin` role.",
            isOptional: true,
        },
        {
            name: "banned",
            type: "boolean",
            description: "Indicates whether the user is banned.",
            isOptional: true,
        },
        {
            name: "banReason",
            type: "string",
            description: "The reason for the user's ban.",
            isOptional: true,
        },
        {
            name: "banExpires",
            type: "number",
            description: "The Unix timestamp when the user's ban will expire.",
            isOptional: true,
        },
    ]}
/>

And adds one field in the `session` table:

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        {
            name: "impersonatedBy",
            type: "string",
            description: "The ID of the admin that is impersonating this session.",
            isOptional: true,
        },
    ]}
/>
