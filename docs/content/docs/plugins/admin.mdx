description: Admin plugin for Better Auth
---

The Admin plugin provides a set of administrative functions for user management in your application. It allows administrators to perform various operations such as creating users, listing users, managing user roles, banning/unbanning users, and more.


## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To use the Admin plugin, add it to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { admin } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            admin() // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Migrate your database

    Run the migration command to create the necessary tables in your database.

    ```bash title="terminal"
    npx better-auth migrate # [!code highlight]
    ```

    Alternatively, you can generate the required tables with:

    ```bash title="terminal"
    npx better-auth generate
    ```

    Refer to the [Schema section](#schema) to see which fields this plugin requires. You can also manually add these fields to your database if necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Next, include the anonymous client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { adminClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    const client = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            adminClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Before performing any admin operations, the user must be authenticated with an admin account. An admin is any user assigned the `admin` role. For the first admin user, you'll need to manually assign the `admin` role to their account in your database.

### Create User

Allows an admin to create a new user.

```ts
const newUser = await client.admin.createUser({
  name: "Test User",
  email: "test@example.com",
  password: "password123",
  role: "user"
});
```

### List Users

Allows an admin to list all users in the database.

```ts
const users = await client.admin.listUsers();
```
By default, 100 users are returned. You can adjust the limit and offset using the following query parameters:

- `limit`: The number of users to return.
- `offset`: The number of users to skip.
- `sortBy`: The field to sort the users by.

```ts
const users = await client.admin.listUsers({
    query: {
        limit: 10,
        offset: 0,
        sortBy: "createdAt"
    }
});
```
